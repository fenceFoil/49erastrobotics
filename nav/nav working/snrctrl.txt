robot
4 parts
	forward
	dig
	back
	dump

each part has 1 or more stages
	turning etc
each part has 1 or more cases
	which location are we going to?

control goals

	turn to where we want to go
			travel to goal
	each step along the way there is a place we should be going to, not nessecarily the final position but somewhere along the way
	the angle desired is tan^-1((ygoal-ycurrent)/(xgoal-xcurrent)
	the current angle is given from localization and is negative of what we want the desired angle 
	
GOING TO MINE
the error in the angle is angle desired-angle current


		if the error is positive that means we are too shallow and need to turn  more
		if the error is negative that means we are too high and need to turn back down
		for each update or delta of 1 ft x we should update the new goal position
			this is only important in the turning section of the path
			we are pretty much limited to turning rates with a max ratio of .133 vs .05 for pwm
			
		so set a threshold of if the error is between +- 5 degrees or something we drive straight
			otherwise max turn untill we get within that margin
				would it be a good idea to no shit get the error to zero before we start operating w/in the band?
				cause it can drive straight really well
			

start 	part 1
	go forward
		straight 	part 1 stage 1
		turn		part 1 stage 2
			location left =		case 1
			location right=		case 2
		straight 	part 1 stage 3
			
stop 	part 2
	dig 			part 2 stage 1
start 	part 3
	go backward
		straight 	part 3 stage 1
		turn	 	part 3 stage 2
			location left =		case 1
			location right=		case 2
		straight 	part 3 stage 3
stop 	part 4
	dump 			part 4 stage 1
repeat

you turn by setting the angle
